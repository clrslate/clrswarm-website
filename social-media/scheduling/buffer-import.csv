Every engineer has been there: production is down, alerts are firing, and you're frantically switching between monitoring tools trying to understand what's happening.

We built ClrSwarm because we've lived this pain.

**The vision:**

Engineering operational data should be unified, not siloed. Investigations should be accelerated, not manual. Insights should be actionable, not buried.

**What we're launching October 7:**

• Unified telemetry pipeline – one source of truth
• Actionable correlation engine – automatic pattern detection  
• Human + AI workflows – faster investigation and resolution

**Our mission:**

Orchestrate clarity across your engineering data.

After months of development, we're launching ClrSwarm – a platform designed to orchestrate clarity across engineering operational data.

**What is ClrSwarm?**

Modern engineering teams are drowning in telemetry. Metrics, logs, traces, and events come from dozens of sources, making it nearly impossible to get a unified view when things go wrong.

ClrSwarm addresses this by providing:
• Unified telemetry pipeline – one place for all your signals
• Actionable correlation engine – intelligent pattern detection
• Human + AI investigation workflows – accelerate root cause analysis

**Why we built this:**

We've experienced firsthand the challenges of debugging distributed systems. The problem isn't lack of data – it's making sense of it all. ClrSwarm turns distributed signals into unified insight.

LinkedIn,2025-10-07,17:00,"**Three capabilities that set ClrSwarm apart:**

🔹 **Unified Telemetry Pipeline**
Ingest metrics, logs, traces, and events from any source. One pipeline, one query language, unified insights.

🔹 **Actionable Correlation Engine**  
Automatically detect patterns across signal types. Find the root cause faster with intelligent correlation.

🔹 **Human + AI Investigation Workflows**
Accelerate debugging with AI-assisted investigation. Get suggestions, not just dashboards.

**Launch date:** October 7, 2025

Modern engineering teams need more than monitoring – they need orchestrated clarity.
